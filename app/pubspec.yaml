  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/logo.png
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins.ttf
    # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
    # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
